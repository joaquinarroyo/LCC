/// Data structures for simulating the execution of user programs running on
/// top of Nachos.
///
/// User programs are loaded into `mainMemory`; to Nachos, this looks just
/// like an array of bytes.  Of course, the Nachos kernel is in memory too --
/// but as in most machines these days, the kernel is loaded into a separate
/// memory region from user programs, and accesses to kernel memory are not
/// translated or paged.
///
/// In Nachos, user programs are executed one instruction at a time, by the
/// simulator.  Each memory reference is translated, checked for errors, etc.
