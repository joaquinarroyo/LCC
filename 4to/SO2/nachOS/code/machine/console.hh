/// Data structures to simulate the behavior of a terminal I/O device.
///
/// A terminal has two parts -- a keyboard input, and a display output, each
/// of which produces/accepts characters sequentially.
///
/// The console hardware device is asynchronous.  When a character is written
/// to the device, the routine returns immediately, and an interrupt handler
/// is called later when the I/O completes.  For reads, an interrupt handler
/// is called when a character arrives.
///
/// The user of the device can specify the routines to be called when the
/// read/write interrupts occur.  There is a separate interrupt for read and
/// write, and the device is “duplex” -- a character can be outgoing and
/// incoming at the same time.
///
/// DO NOT CHANGE -- part of the machine emulation
