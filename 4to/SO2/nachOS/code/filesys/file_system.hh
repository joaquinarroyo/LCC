/// Data structures to represent the Nachos file system.
///
/// A file system is a set of files stored on disk, organized into
/// directories.  Operations on the file system have to do with “naming” --
/// creating, opening, and deleting files, given a textual file name.
/// Operations on an individual “open” file (read, write, close) are to be
/// found in the `OpenFile` class (`openfile.h`).
///
/// We define two separate implementations of the file system:
///
/// * The `STUB` version just re-defines the Nachos file system operations as
///   operations on the native UNIX file system on the machine running the
///   Nachos simulation.  This is provided in case the multiprogramming and
///   virtual memory assignments (which make use of the file system) are done
///   before the file system assignment.
///
/// * The other version is a “real” file system, built on top of a disk
///   simulator.  The disk is simulated using the native UNIX file system (in
///   a file named `DISK`).
///
///   In the "real" implementation, there are two key data structures used in
///   the file system.  There is a single “root” directory, listing all of
///   the files in the file system; unlike UNIX, the baseline system does not
///   provide a hierarchical directory structure.  In addition, there is a
///   bitmap for allocating disk sectors.  Both the root directory and the
///   bitmap are themselves stored as files in the Nachos file system -- this
///   causes an interesting bootstrap problem when the simulated disk is
///   initialized.
