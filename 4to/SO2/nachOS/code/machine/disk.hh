/// Data structures to emulate a physical disk.

/// next request can be sent to the disk.
///
/// Disk contents are preserved across machine crashes, but if a file system
/// operation (eg, create a file) is in progress when the system shuts down,
/// the file system may be corrupted.

/// The following class defines a physical disk I/O device.
///
/// The disk has a single surface, split up into “tracks”, and each track
/// split up into "sectors" (the same number of sectors on each track, and
/// each sector has the same number of bytes of storage).
///
/// Addressing is by sector number -- each sector on the disk is given a
/// unique number: `track * SECTORS_PER_TRACK + offset` within a track.
///
/// As with other I/O devices, the raw physical disk is an asynchronous
/// device -- requests to read or write portions of the disk return
/// immediately, and an interrupt is invoked later to signal that the
/// operation completed.
///
/// The physical disk is in fact simulated via operations on a UNIX file.
///
/// To make life a little more realistic, the simulated time for each
/// operation reflects a “track buffer” -- RAM to store the contents of the
/// current track as the disk head passes by.  The idea is that the disk
/// always transfers to the track buffer, in case that data is requested
/// later on.  This has the benefit of eliminating the need for "skip-sector"
/// scheduling -- a read request which comes in shortly after the head has
/// passed the beginning of the sector can be satisfied more quickly, because
/// its contents are in the track buffer.  Most disks these days now come
/// with a track buffer.
///
/// The track buffer simulation can be disabled by compiling with
/// `-DNOTRACKBUF`.
