/// Data structures for providing the abstraction of unreliable, ordered,

///
/// The US Post Office delivers mail to the addressed mailbox.  By analogy,
/// our post office delivers packets to a specific buffer (`MailBox`), based
/// on the mailbox number stored in the packet header.  Mail waits in the box
/// until a thread asks for it; if the mailbox is empty, threads can wait for
/// mail to arrive in it.
///
/// Thus, the service our post office provides is to de-multiplex incoming
/// packets, delivering them to the appropriate thread.
///
/// With each message, you get a return address, which consists of a “from
/// address”, which is the id of the machine that sent the message, and a
/// “from box”, which is the number of a mailbox on the sending machine to
/// which you can send an acknowledgement, if your protocol requires this.
