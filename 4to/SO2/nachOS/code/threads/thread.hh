/// Data structures for managing threads.
///
/// A thread represents sequential execution of code within a program.  So
/// the state of a thread includes the program counter, the processor
/// registers, and the execution stack.
///
/// Note that because we allocate a fixed size stack for each thread, it is
/// possible to overflow the stack -- for instance, by recursing to too deep
/// a level.  The most common reason for this occuring is allocating large
/// data structures on the stack.  For instance, this will cause problems:
///
///     void foo() { int buf[1000]; ...}
///
/// Instead, you should allocate all data structures dynamically:
///
///     void foo() { int *buf = new int [1000]; ...}
///
/// Bad things happen if you overflow the stack, and in the worst case, the
/// problem may not be caught explicitly.  Instead, the only symptom may be
/// bizarre segmentation faults.  (Of course, other problems can cause seg
/// faults, so that is not a sure sign that your thread stacks are too
/// small.)
///
/// One thing to try if you find yourself with segmentation faults is to
/// increase the size of thread stack -- `STACK_SIZE`.
///
/// In this interface, forking a thread takes two steps.  We must first
/// allocate a data structure for it:
///     t = new Thread
/// Only then can we do the fork:
///     t->Fork(f, arg)
