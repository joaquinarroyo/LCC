/// Data structures to emulate a hardware timer.
///
/// A hardware timer generates a CPU interrupt every X milliseconds.
/// This means it can be used for implementing time-slicing, or for
/// having a thread go to sleep for a specific period of time.
///
/// We emulate a hardware timer by scheduling an interrupt to occur every
/// time `stats->totalTicks` has increased by `TIMER_TICKS`.
///
/// In order to introduce some randomness into time-slicing, if `doRandom` is
/// set, then the interrupt comes after a random number of ticks.
///
/// DO NOT CHANGE -- part of the machine emulation
