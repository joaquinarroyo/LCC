/// This class defines a “condition variable”.
///
/// A condition variable does not have any value.  It is used for enqueuing
/// threads that are waiting (`Wait`) that another thread informs them of
/// something (`Signal`).  Condition variables are bound to a lock (`Lock`).
///
/// These are the three operations on condition variables:
///
/// * `Wait` -- free the lock and displace the thread from the CPU.  The
///   thread will wait until someone sends it a `Signal`.
/// * `Signal` -- if there is someone waiting on the variable, awaken one of
///   the threads. If there is none waiting, nothing occurs.
/// * `Broadcast` -- awaken all waiting threads.
///
/// All operations on a condition variable must be performed after having
/// acquired the lock.  This means that operations on condition variables
/// must be executed in mutual exclusion.
///
/// Nachos' condition variables should work according to the “Mesa” style.
/// When a `Signal` or `Broadcast` awakens another thread, this is put in the
/// ready queue.  The woken thread is responsible for acquiring the lock
/// again.  This has to be implemented in the body of the `Wait` function.
///
/// In contrast, there exists another style of condition variables, the
/// “Hoare” style: according to it, `Signal` loses control of the lock and
/// delivers the CPU to the woken thread; this is run immediately and when
/// the lock is freed, the thread returns control to the thread that
/// performed the `Signal`.
///
/// The “Mesa” style is somewhat simpler to implement, but it does not
/// guarantee that the woken thread recover the control of the lock
/// immediately.
