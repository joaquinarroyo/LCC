/// device -- requests to read or write portions of the disk return
/// immediately, and an interrupt occurs later to signal that the operation
/// completed.  (Also, the physical characteristics of the disk device assume
/// that only one operation can be requested at a time).

/// a request, it waits around until the operation finishes before returning.
