/// Data structures to emulate low-level interrupt hardware.
///
/// The hardware provides a routine (`SetLevel`) to enable or disable
/// interrupts.
///
/// In order to emulate the hardware, we need to keep track of all interrupts
/// the hardware devices would cause, and when they are supposed to occur.
///
/// This module also keeps track of simulated time.  Time advances
/// only when the following occur:
///
/// * interrupts are re-enabled;
/// * a user instruction is executed;
/// * there is nothing in the ready queue.
///
/// As a result, unlike real hardware, interrupts (and thus time-slice
/// context switches) cannot occur anywhere in the code where interrupts are
/// enabled, but rather only at those places in the code where simulated time
/// advances (so that it becomes time to invoke an interrupt in the hardware
/// simulation).
///
/// NOTE: this means that incorrectly synchronized code may work fine on this
/// hardware simulation (even with randomized time slices), but it would not
/// work on real hardware.  (Just because we cannot always detect when your
/// program would fail in real life, does not mean it is ok to write
/// incorrectly synchronized code!)
